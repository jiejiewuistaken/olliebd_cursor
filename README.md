# Floating Cinema Gallery

An interactive React Three Fiber scene with a dark cinema space, a glowing floating
screen, rolling procedural picture/video cards, draggable camera perspective, and
gift hint markers hidden on the theater chairs.

## Preview

Install dependencies, then start the Vite dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the local URL printed by Vite. In Cursor Cloud, use the forwarded port for
the Vite server on port `5174`.

Controls:

- Drag to rotate around the cinema.
- Scroll to zoom in and out.
- Look across the seats to find the glowing gift hints.

## Troubleshooting

If the page is blank with a stale Drei/Bloom export error, stop the dev server,
restart it with `npm run dev`, and hard-refresh the browser tab. The dev script
forces Vite to rebuild its optimized dependency cache.

This project uses port `5174` for dev preview to avoid stale Vite preview
state from older local servers.
